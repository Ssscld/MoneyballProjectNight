    "Sabermetrics is the apllication of statistical analysis to baseball data in order to measure in-game activity. The term Sabermetrics comes from saber (Society for American Baseball Research) and metrics (as in econometrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2003, Michael Lewis published Moneyball about Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics General Manager since 1997. The book was centered around Billy Beane's use of Sabemetrics to identify and recruit under-valued baseball players. With this strategy, his team could achieve as many wins as teams with more than double the payroll. The figures below show the relationship between team salaries and number of wins for years: 1997, 2001, 2003, 2013. The green dot represents the Oakland Athletics, the blue dot represents the New York Yankees, and the red dot represents The Boston Red Sox. We can see that the Oakland Athletics went from the underperforming team in 1997, to became a highly competitive team with a comparable number of wins to the New York Yankees. The Oakland Athletics made it to the play-offs in 4 successive years: 2000,2001,2002,2003.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2011, the movie Moneyball based on Lewis' book was released starring Brad Pitt in the role of Beane."
